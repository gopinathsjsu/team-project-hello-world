# XP Core Values that were Implemented during the project developement  

# Communication
*	Communication has been an important element that our team has followed throughout the project. We have scheduled a weekly sprint meeting on Friday 10:30 PDT. Our team has followed hybrid strategy to set up meetings, we have met in person in MLK Library rooms and also used Zoom, GoogleMeets for online sprint meetings.
*	We have used Whatsapp as our main source of communication. It became extremely easy for teh team to get and give updates to each other and put forward the concerns and most importantly having a platform to address our concerns has benefited the team with the easy execution of tasks.
*	In the weekly sprints we monitored and identified our progress and blockers. We discussed in detail regarding any concerns or difficulties the teammates are facing. Our key goal was to help eachother to resolve any blockages and to set up a cumculative agenda for the coming week.

# Simplicity
*	In the initial planning phase of the project developement, we as a team have discussed and proposed various ways each feature can be addressed and then chose the simplest approach.
*	The main goal here is to avoid wastage of resources and time while we do only absolutely necessary tasks, this was acheived by keeping the design model of the project as simple as possible so that it is easier to maintain, support, and revise.
*	To implement simplicity in our project we have divided the research tasks, shared knowledge and have supported each others proposals with respect.
*	We have worked on gathering the apt requirements and comprehending the definition of the project, followed a simple moto "to do only what is needed".
*	We have aggresively worked and communicated with each otehr to avoid any duplications in tasks and code. This startegy has helped us fastrack our progress and concentrate more on new set of functionaities.

# Feedback
* Feed Back is important in the project developement as it will portray the to honest estimates, help identify the potential hurdles and map the progess of the project.
*	We have realised early in our sprint meetings that feedback plays a very important role to understand different perspectives and do what is best for the project.
*	We have assured ech other that we will dedicatedly listen to what other's have to say and accept all feedback and healthy critisisism positively.
*	We have dedicated 5 minute feedback session at the end of each sprint meeting to check and monitor the progress of each teammate and any correction that needs to be addressed
*	Feedback helped us in identifying the roadblocks, improve and perform better.

# Courage

*	It was essential to stay courageous to face the hurdles we have come across throughout the project development
*	We aapreciate ourself to be courageous enough to give and take critisism in a respectful and positive way.
*	It helped the team overall as we have been courages enough to take a step and call out any critical issues during the building of various functionalities.
*	Team members had the courage to speak up, ask for help and be vulnerable.

# Respect

*	We have assured each other dignity and respect at any given point of the project.
*	We truly cared of each other's well being and their work.
*	Every teammate has the freedom to propose a new feature, express their point of view and prespectives without the fear of recieving harsh criticism from 
teammates
